Blinkit Data Analysis Dashboard – Trends and Insights
Short Description/Purpose: This dashboard presents a snapshot analysis of Blinkit's sales, operational performance, and product categorization, likely aimed at identifying key drivers of total sales, average rating, and outlet performance. It helps stakeholders understand the impact of Fat Content, Item Type, and Outlet Size/Type on sales and other key metrics. The goal is to uncover trends for inventory management, store expansion strategies, and optimizing product mix for maximum sales and customer satisfaction.

Tech Stack (Technologies Used):

Power BI (Implied) – For creating the interactive and visually rich dashboard.

Data Visualization Tools – KPI cards, area chart, donut charts, bar charts, and a table/matrix visualization for easy data interpretation.

Trends and Distributions:
Outlet Establishment Trend (Area Chart): Shows the number of outlets established over time, peaking around 2018 (205K) before slightly declining and stabilizing around 131K in 2022.

Performance Metrics:
Fat Content Analysis (Donut Chart & Bar Chart):

The donut chart suggests a roughly equal split in the count or average of Low Fat and Regular items (both around 4 on the scale).

The bar chart (Fat By Outlet) shows a consistent average rating of 4 across different outlet tiers (Tier 1, Tier 3, Tier 2) for both Low Fat and Regular items.

Item Type Analysis (Bar Chart): Displays item types ranked, with Meat and Household being prominent (high count/average on the x-axis).

Outlet Type Performance Table: Provides a detailed breakdown of sales and key metrics by Outlet Type:

Supermarket Type1 has the highest Total Sales (787.55K) and No. of Items (5577).

Grocery Store and the Supermarket Types generally maintain an Average Rating of 4 and similar Average Sales (around 140-142).

Supermarket Type1 also has a relatively higher Average of Item Visibility (0.07).

This comprehensive dashboard allows managers to quickly identify the most effective outlet types and sizes (e.g., Supermarket Type1, Medium size) and the most lucrative location tier (Tier 3), while also monitoring product attributes like Fat Content and Item Type to guide strategic decisions on stock and store location.
