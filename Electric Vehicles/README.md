Project Title/Headline: Electric Vehicles Analysis Dashboard – Trends and Insights

Short Description/Purpose: This dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of electric vehicle (EV) adoption, performance, and distribution across various dimensions. It helps track total vehicles, average electric range, clean alternative fuel vehicle (CAFV) eligibility, and market share by make and model. The goal is to uncover key trends in EV growth, range performance, and manufacturer dominance to support data-driven policy-making, investment, and consumer adoption strategies.

Tech Stack (Technologies Used):

Power BI – for building interactive and visually engaging dashboards
Power Query Editor – for preprocessing and transforming EV dataset
Data Visualization Tools – line charts, donut charts, bar graphs, tree maps, and KPIs for easy interpretation
Data Source: Electric Vehicle Dataset (Excel/CSV) including attributes such as:

Model Year
Vehicle Make and Model
Vehicle Type (BEV, PHEV)
Electric Range
MSRP (Base Price)
CAFV Eligibility
Registration Location and Utility Information
Features and Highlights:

Key KPIs:

Total Vehicles (150.42K)
Average Electric Range (67.83 Km)
BEV Vehicles (117K, 78%)
PHEV Vehicles (34K, 22%)
Trends Over Time: Line chart showing total vehicles registered by model year, highlighting significant adoption spikes in recent years.

CAFV Eligibility: Donut chart showing distribution of CAFV-eligible vehicles (46.33%), non-eligible vehicles (41.81%), and partial (11.86%).

Market Share by Manufacturer: Bar chart of total vehicles by make, with Tesla leading at 69K vehicles, followed by Nissan, Chevrolet, and Ford.

Vehicle Performance Metrics:

Maximum Electric Range (674 Km)
Average Base MSRP (1.28K in dataset scale)
Vehicle Models Analysis: Tree map visualization of popular EV models, with Tesla’s Model Y (29K) and Model 3 (28K) dominating, followed by Nissan Leaf (13K) and Chevrolet Bolt EV.

This comprehensive dashboard enables stakeholders, manufacturers, and policymakers to monitor electric vehicle market adoption, analyze manufacturer and model-level performance, and track eligibility for clean fuel programs—supporting strategic growth in sustainable mobility.
